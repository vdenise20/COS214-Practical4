CropField:
-getSoilStateName() should also be in Abstract class
-added setter method updateCurrentCrops(int num) to update the number of crops in the field after harvesting. Added to abstract class as well.
-added yield variable to store how many crops can be harvested from the field.
-added a getYield method.

Truck:
-Since both Trucks have the same functions, shouldnt they be pure virtual functions in the base class?
-the update function is callTruck according to the spec so it needs to be changed to that
-added a bool isPurchased variable

CropFieldDecorator:
-wrappedField should be protected not private and should be of type CropFieldInterface*
-The inherited classes no longer need variables as i hardcoded them. Adding the variables makes the code interaction between patterns very complex

CropFieldInterface:
-made the observerList protected so i could access it from the child class.

Iterators:
-changed the type of currentIndex to FarmUnit* since none of the iterators in STL i'm using use int indexes.
-changed elements type to queue in breadthFirst and stack in depth first
-changed the return type of currentFarm to FarmUnit*
